# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Guided Projects

Welcome to my collection of JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms modules! These guided mini-projects are part of the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) curriculum, designed to help you learn the skills necessary to understand and implement various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. Completing these projects is a key step toward obtaining the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

## Overview

As part of the FCC JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification, these projects are designed to provide hands-on experience with various data structures and algorithms. Each project focuses on different aspects of algorithmic thinking and problem-solving, helping me to build a strong foundation in JavaScript.

## Progress

Through these projects, I was able to obtain my FCC certification for JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures! I have created more specific repositories for the major projects! These ones are just the minor ones that you complete to learn the necessary skills! I have numbered the projects based on their sequence of completion. Here is a link to the curriculum: [FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

## Learning Path

By working through these projects, I gained practical experience with skills such as:

- JavaScript syntax and features
- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving
- Data structures such as arrays, objects, and strings

- Validating data and string manipulation
